		<h1>USA vs Portugal</h1>
		<h2>Written by Kyle D. on 6/22/2014</h2>
		<p>Wow, what a roller coaster of a game!  The US deserved three points, but a last minute goal by Varela (with a ridiculous delivery by Cristiano Ronaldo) prevented the US from becoming the first team in Group G to advance to the knockout stages.</p>
		<p>If the US had held on, they wouldve clinched a spot in the final 16.  With a  matchup looming against the German dream team in 4 days, the US really needed this W against the world's best player.  Now, theyre in a position where they need to win or tie against Germany to be assured of advancing.  A loss, and it gets dicey.</p>
		<p>The craziest thing about this whole scenario...if the US loses to Germany on Thursday, and Ghana beats Portugal, US and Ghana will be tied for second place in their group.  Even though the US beat Ghana in their group matchup, Ghana looks likely to advance due to the tie breaker- goal differential.  Only FIFA would come up with such a god awful rule.  The US BEAT Ghana head to head.  If they end up in a tie for second place, Ghana can and likely will advance.  What a shame.  In a country where soccer is already second guessed and under a huge microscope, this could be the nail in the coffin for the sport.  Lets hope the US can come away with the point/s needed against Germany on Thursday morning so the sport gains the steam in this country that it so rightfully deserves.</p>
