		<h1>National Lampoon's European Vacation 2.0</h1>
		<h2>Written by Kyle D. on 6/22/2014</h2>
		<p>On another note, I'll be flying to the country we so desperately need a win against (Germany) on Thursday, at the same time as the game.  Good thing I've got my loving wife to keep me from trying to jump out of the plane mid-flight.  Dont get me wrong, Im excited about our trip...but my head might explode trying to keep track of two seperate crucial matches, on an airplane with sure to be choppy internet connections.  Its gonna get interesting, thats for sure.</p>
		<p>With a little luck, we'll arrive in Munich, Germany on Friday morning.  Then we head to Rothenberg, one of the most well preserved midieval walled towns in all of Europe.  We'll spend a couple of days exploring, then head to the Rhine River Valley, where we'll drink beer and stumble into castle after castle hoping to find our way to World Cup glory.  After a couple days there, we'll make our way towards Paris, with a few stops along the way (possibly Belgium and/or Luxembourg...any suggestions?).  We'll take a few days in Paris, watching World Cup soccer under the Eifel Tower and Notre Dame (romantic, I know) until we fly back to the States</p>
		<p>I'm pumped for the opportunity to go explore Germany and France with my wife, who's never been to Europe, along with my parents.  It'll be nice to spend some much needed time together while exploring some really cool places.  Keep an eye out for some updates and pictures...<p/>
